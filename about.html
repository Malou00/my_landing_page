  <h1>About BantsApp</h1>

  <p>Welcome to <strong>BantsApp</strong>the chaotic corner of the internet where short videos, weird memes, and scroll-worthy moments live their best life.</p>

  <p>This isn't another "social media platform." It's more like your group chat exploded into a website. If it makes you laugh, think, or snort air out of your nose, it belongs here.</p>

  <h2>ðŸŽ¯ Why We Built This</h2>
  <p>Letâ€™s be real the internet is fun, but itâ€™s also a mess. Too many ads, fake engagement, and boring timelines. So we built MemeHub to bring it back to basics: pure, unfiltered, bite-sized entertainment.</p>
  <p>Think of it as a digital playground for your inner meme lord (or meme goblin we donâ€™t judge).</p>

  <h2>ðŸ‘‹ Whoâ€™s Behind It?</h2>
  <p>Hey, Iâ€™m Malou and Atem Ajak two developers who got tired of sending memes to themselves at 2AM. So We built this place as a fun side project... and then it kind of became a thing.</p>
  <p>No big team. No investors. Just a passion for good code and bad jokes.</p>

 
  <h2>ðŸ“¬ Get Involved</h2>
  <p>Have something hilarious to share? Got feedback, ideas, or just want to say hi?</p>
  <ul>

    <li>Use the hashtag <strong>#BantsApp</strong> if you post your stuff elsewhere</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>ðŸš€ Whatâ€™s Next?</h2>
  <p>This is just the beginning. Weâ€™ve got cool features coming soon like  trending tags and maybe even a dark mode (because duh).</p>

  <p>Thanks for stopping by. Now get back to scrolling. ðŸ˜‰</p>
